mutest
======

`mutest` is **retired**.

It was a fork of [mutant](https://github.com/mbj/mutant) project with a few misc. customizations including inline source code disables. I no longer have interest in maintaining this and it is buggier than `mutant`. I am hoping for some of the handful of features this added to be eventually fully supported on `mutant`. If you are curious about how this project differed from `mutant` at the time, the [CHANGELOG](CHANGELOG.md) has some context.
